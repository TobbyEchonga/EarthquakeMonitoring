# EarthquakeMonitoring
This is a earthquake monitoring web application I worked on to display major earthquakes within a specific period of time

The information is got from a US base Earthquake Api called https://earthquake.usgs.gov/
Its extracted and stored locally on the PC 
Then using the various maps that is recent earthquakes or over period of a month
You can view the various earthqukaes that occured in during those periods of time 

The whole application was developed in Visual studio using vb, html, css and javascript.

All the icons are from the google link.
